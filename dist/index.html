            Raising children is expensive enough without adding high medical costs on top, which is why most Australian
            families have private family health insurance. <br /><br />
            As a parent you want to protect your children so they can grow up to be healthy and happy, but even the
            healthiest children can encounter regular illnesses and occasional injuries. In the event that you have to
            deal with a long-term or serious illness in the family, medical costs can quickly spiral out of control.
            <br /><br />
            The best family health insurance can help ease the financial burden of raising a family and give you the
            reassurance that comes with knowing you are covered in case of the unexpected, so it’s important to do your
            research and compare the family health insurance policies that are out there to get the best deal possible.
            <br /><br />
            Whether you’re first time parents, you’re expanding your family or it’s been a while since you reviewed your
            health insurance policy, now is a good time to speak to someone about whether your current policy is meeting
            all your needs. <br /><br />
            As you know, families change very quickly and your health insurance should grow with you. Our health
            insurance experts can help you compare family health insurance policies to find the best one for your
            family’s growing needs with one simple, half-hour phone call. <br /><br />
            Switching health insurance providers is easier than you think. You don’t need to re-serve waiting periods
            when you transfer to a cover with equivalent benefits… even if you have a pre-existing condition. Call us
            today and we can clarify any questions that you may have in regards to family health insurance.

          <p class="main-content__paragraph-content">
            Health insurance is designed to cover you for different life stages. Before meeting your partner or starting
            a family you probably had an individual health insurance policy. You may have kept this when you met your
            partner, or you might have changed to a couple’s policy where you were both included. <br /><br />
            When considering starting a family, most couples decide to switch to a family health insurance policy. While
            you can in theory, take out a separate policy for each individual member of the family, a family policy lets
            you combine cover for everyone. <br /><br />
            This is more convenient and usually cheaper than taking out individual cover and because family health
            insurance is tailored to meet the needs of people at this particular stage of their lives, the level and
            type of cover provided is usually more suited to the needs of families than a generic policy. <br /><br />
            If you’re expecting, it’s a good idea to take out family cover early so that your baby will be covered from
            birth. It’s also important to be aware that whatever type of health insurance policy you have now, you will
            need to have obstetrics cover for at least 12 months before the birth of your baby to ensure you will be
            covered for the birth-related hospital costs.

          <p class="main-content__paragraph-content">
            While it may seem obvious to switch from a singles or couples policy to a family one when you’re expecting,
            as your family grows it’s equally important to make sure your health insurance policy keeps up with your
            changing needs. <br /><br />
            From baby care to early childhood development where you might need treatment like speech therapy and
            occupational therapy, to glasses and braces for your teenager, it’s important to review your family’s health
            insurance policy on a regular basis to make sure it’s still appropriate for you.

                Many children experience difficulties with their speech or physical development as they grow. These
                issues can often be corrected with the right therapy, but it’s expensive and not usually covered by
                Medicare. The right extras cover on your family health insurance policy means that your child can get
                the help they need to get back on track before they are affected over the long term.

                Children invariably have accidents and illnesses that may require hospital treatment. With the right
                hospital cover your family will be covered for some or all of the costs and for long term issues you
                will have more affordable access to quality private treatment, shorter waiting lists and your choice of
                health care provider.

            Family policies are tailored to the specific needs of families, so you can get access to the services you
            need without having to pay extra on your premium for unnecessary cover.

          <p class="main-content__paragraph-content">
            Your children can remain on your family policy until they are 25 provided they are full-time students and
            still your dependents. Once they stop studying full time or turn 25 they will usually need to purchase their
            own health insurance policy. <br /><br />
            Some health insurance policies ask you to pay a higher premium once your children are over the age of 18 and
            not studying full-time. If this is the case for you, it may be time to review your policy and look around
            for one that is more suited to your family’s situation. <br /><br />
            If your children have left home you will probably want to change from a family to a singles or couples’
            insurance policy. This can help you reduce your premium costs and ensure that you’re covered for any medical
            issues you may experience in the future. <br /><br />

            policy for your family’s changing needs. Fill out your details below or give us a call and we’ll find you
